As a user I would like to allow the option to play with shapes larger than 4 blocks, because it would allow me to make the game a little harder.
As a user, I would like to be able to customize my game by having the option to change the background color.
As a user, I would like the option to make figures all one color or keep multicolor, to allow me to have more customization over the game.
