# Executive Summary

## Project Overview:
The Tetris Refactoring Project was initiated with the primary goal of enhancing the existing Tetris game implemented in Python by applying advanced design principles and strategies. The project aimed to improve the codebase's maintainability, scalability, and overall quality, ensuring a more robust foundation for future development.

## Objective:
The main objectives of the project were:

Design Refinement: Implementing industry-standard design principles to enhance the overall architecture of the Tetris game, making the code more modular and extensible.

Feature Expansion: Each team member was tasked with implementing new features to enrich the gaming experience. These features included but were not limited to customizable themes, sounds, and pause buttons.

Testing Strategy: Establishing a comprehensive testing framework to ensure the reliability and correctness of the refactored code. This included unit tests and integration tests.

## Project Structure:
The first part of the project was refactoring the code to create a useable starting codebase.

Then teammembers reported progress weekly both to the team leader and in class, using sprint meetings.

Then, groups were given a deadline in order to create a final working, tested, project.

## Results:
The Tetris Refactoring Project has yielded significant improvements in several key areas:

Code Quality: The refactored code uses some of the principles we have learned, resulting in improved readability, maintainability, and scalability.

New Features: The addition of pause buttons, sound, game over screens, color schemes, advanced figures, helping provide users with a more engaging and versatile Tetris game.

Testing Confidence: The comprehensive testing strategy has significantly increased confidence in the reliability of the code. Automated tests ensure that both existing and new features continue to function correctly, even with future modifications.

Conclusion:
The Tetris Refactoring Project has successfully achieved its goals, delivering a refined and feature-rich Tetris game with a solid foundation for future development. The team's commitment to applying sound design principles and implementing a robust testing strategy has resulted in a high-quality product that meets the expectations of both users and stakeholders. The refactored Tetris game is positioned for continued success and adaptability in the ever-evolving landscape of software development
