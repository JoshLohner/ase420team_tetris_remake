Amaya Bryant:

As a user, I would like to know when my game is over and to be able to press 'r' to restart my game because it will make it more convenient to play again.
As a user, I would like a pause feature in case I need to walk away from my game and come back.
As a user, I would like a sound indication for the Tetris pieces if I rotate them and a different sound once the piece has landed.
